Portfolio for the course Computational Musicology

In this course i will analyse a corpus of 50-100 songs. My corpus contains songs of the artist named Drake. He considers himself to be a rapper, but many say he makes music closer to the pop genre. I think it is a little more complex and i would like to compare Drake's songs to the charts of specific genres. Think about the charts of Hip-hop/R&B/pop and so on. This way i hope i can find in what genre his music can be found. Or if he makes different songs in different genres. If the last is the case, in what genre does he score the best? 

Some things to consider are that i do not know who made the charts on spotify. So i do not know who chose that a specific song belongs in a certain genre. 

The plot added is a first comparison between the Hip-hop charts and 10 of the best scoring songs of drake. In the plot we can see the top songs score prettey 'average' on the added categories. Unfortunately due to some time issues i only used the variables provided in class. Later i would like get a better analasis. The other problem with my data is that i am comparing 10 drake songs with 200 songs in the hip-hop chart. This way the information is not sufficient and the visualazation is a bit weird. For the next week i wan't to fix this.
