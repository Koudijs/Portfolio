Portfolio for the course Computational Musicology

In this course i will analyse a corpus of 50-100 songs. My corpus contains songs of the artist named Drake. He considers himself to be a rapper, but many say he makes music closer to the pop genre. I think it is a little more complex and i would like to compare Drake's songs to the charts of specific genres. Think about the charts of Hip-hop/R&B/pop and so on. This way i hope i can find in what genre his music can be found. Or if he makes different songs in different genres. If the last is the case, in what genre does he score the best? 

Some things to consider are that i do not know who made the charts on spotify. So i do not know who chose that a specific song belongs in a certain genre.
